# Jetpack Compose CollapsibleText

A Jetpack Compose Text component that will collapse if its length is extended further than a specified amount of lines. 
It will then ellipsize the text and show a string tag, indicating to the user that there's more text to be shown once tapped. 
When it's fully expanded a new tag will be added indicating that the text can be collapsed again.

If the length of the size fits the number of maxLines, no tags are added.
